# ozp-webtop

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ozone-development/ozp-webtop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ozone-development/ozp-webtop)

Next Gen OZONE UI

## Prerequisites
Install Node.js and npm. Head over to [the Node.js website](http://nodejs.org/) 
if you need to do that.
Next, install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) with 
the command below.

    (sudo) npm install -g bower grunt-cli

## Getting Started
First clone the repo. Then install development dependencies with npm. Install 
frontend app dependencies with Bower:

    cd ozp-webtop
    npm install && bower install
    
### Grunt Tasks
Development tasks are run with Grunt. 

 - `grunt serve` - brings up a live preview of the webtop
 - `grunt build` - executes unit tests
 - `grunt gh-pages` - run after a `grunt build` to publish the build files to [gh-pages](http://ozone-development.github.io/ozp-webtop/)
 
Run `grunt -h` for a full list of Grunt tasks.

## Development Notes

### Use of ng-boilerplate
This app was created from [ng-boilerplate](https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp).
ng-boilerplate uses an opinionated build system that separates files by 
feature/component instead of file type. See the ng-boilerplate repo for detailed 
documentation.

### Directory Structure
The directory structure is a result of ng-boilerplate, but is outlined below: 

```
bin                     # output generated by 'grunt compile'. Production-ready
                        # app (compressed, minified, etc)
build                   # output generated by 'grunt build'. Development-ready
                        # app (not compressed or minified)
demoApps                # examples or placeholders for actual OZP widgets/apps
    bouncingBalls       # the bouncing balls demo (an IWC-enabled application)
    simpleApps          # trivial 'application' examples
karma                   # files specific to karma, a JavaScript test runner
    karma-unit.tpl.js   # karma config file, processed as a Grunt template to 
                        # avoid manual entry of file names
node_modules            # location of installed Node.js dependencies
src                     # our application's source (and a few other things)
    app                 # application-specific JS and HTML templates
        appToolbar      # the toolbar at the bottom where apps can be pinned
        dashboardToolbar# the toolbar at the top for dashboard selection, etc
        dashboardView   # the main part of the page where widgets are displayed
        general         # services, directives, and other things not specific to 
                        # a single feature/component
    assets              # images and anything else that should be copied verbatim
                        # into the build_dir and compile_dir directories
    common              # components that are broadly reusable and not specific
                        # to the application itself
    less                # CSS and LESS files for this application
    index.html          # the index page for our Single Page App (SPA). It's 
                        # processed as a Grunt template so we don't need to 
                        # manually include any CSS or JS files
vendor                  # third-party resources installed by Bower                      
.bowerrc                # configures bower to store components in a 'vendor' 
                        # directory (instead of bower_components)
.travis.yml             # Travis-CI configuration
bower.json              # Bower configuration
build.config.js         # defines the files (or file patterns) used to determine
                        # the files used for various parts of our application's 
                        # build process. Note that any vendor files must be 
                        # explicitly added here (not just to Bower)
Gruntfile.js            # Gruntfile - defines the build process. Identical to 
                        # Gruntfile found in ng-boilerplate, except for changes
                        # noted at the top of the file. Refer to comments for 
                        # the 'build' and 'compile' tasks in the Gruntfile for 
                        # details on the build process. Most important grunt 
                        # tasks are: 'build', 'compile', and 'serve'
module.prefix           # the application script is wrapped in module.prefix and
                        # module.suffix to place the app inside of a self-
                        # executing anonymous function to prevent clashes with 
                        # other libraries
module.suffix           # see above
package.json            # metadata about our app, used by NPM and the build 
                        # script. NPM dependencies are listed here
.gitignore              # files and patterns to ignore for version control
```

## Conventions, Style, etc.
* All HTML templates named *.tpl.html
* All JavaScript test files named *.spec.js
* If you modify the Gruntfile, make sure the modification is noted in comments at 
 the top of the file. This will ensure the original ng-boilerplate docs remain
 as useful as possible
* JavaScript style - use Google's conventions (2 space indentation)
* HTML style - use 2 space indentation 
* Try to keep lines to 80 characters whenever possible

## Production Deployment
To run the production version of Webtop (files minified, concatenated, etc):

1. Follow the steps in the Prerequisites and Getting Started sections above
2. Run ```grunt```. This will create a ```bin/``` directory - statically host
```bin/``` and you're good to go!
3. For testing the production version, run ```grunt run```
